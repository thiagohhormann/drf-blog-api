# Blog API
An API with resources to use and manage a blog

# Documentation 
I made a simple ER diagram and a Class Diagram for the project: <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kCkRgwo4Ht9T0hVhvoRk6RlnZ_1Uueh3/view?usp=sharing">Link with ER Diagram and Class Diagram</a>

Link to APIs endpoints: http://thiago.pythonanywhere.com/api/

The project also has Swagger documentation: http://thiago.pythonanywhere.com/api/swagger/

For now, the project doesn't have the front end.
